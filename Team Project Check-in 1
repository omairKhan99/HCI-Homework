\section{Introduction}
In today's rapidly evolving job market, the process of searching and applying for job opportunities has become increasingly complex and digitalized. Job seekers now routinely utilize online job portals, professional networking platforms, social media, and dedicated recruitment applications to identify potential career opportunities. This shift has increased accessibility and enabled individuals to explore a broader range of job options irrespective of geographical limitations. However, this digitalization has also introduced new complexities, with job seekers needing to monitor and apply through several different platforms, craft tailored digital resumes and profiles, and navigate algorithm-driven job recommendation systems.

Additionally, given the competitive nature of the contemporary job market, job seekers need to differentiate themselves from the other numerous applicants. Online platforms often involve automated screening processes that prioritize specific keywords, qualifications, and experiences, making it essential for candidates to understand these underlying selection mechanisms to maximize their visibility and chances of being shortlisted. Furthermore, the prevalence of virtual interviews and remote hiring practices has become increasingly common, requiring job seekers to develop additional competencies in digital communication and online presentation skills.

Among this extensive landscape of digital employment platforms aimed to streamline recruitment processes and simplify job applications and candidates selection, one popular app is Workday. Workday is a cloud-based software designed to integrate human resources and financial management processes, making it popular across several industries and widely used by companies. The app allows users to explore job opportunities, track multiple job applications, and manage their career data using a single app thanks to its comprehensive integration capabilities. Additionally, Workday ensures real-time updates and secure handling of sensitive data and personal information through advanced encryption and compliance with privacy standards. Not withstanding its positive features, Workday is often criticized for being counterintuitive, frustrating, and cumbersome for job seekers. Our project aims to reimagine and improve the Workday job application experience, making it more user-friendly, efficient, and responsive to the needs of applicants. The current system presents multiple pain points, including difficulties in saving progress, repetitive data entry, poor navigation, and a lack of transparency regarding application status.

Our goal is to redesign the job application process to be more seamless and intuitive. Job seekers should be able to easily apply for positions, track their progress, and receive relevant updates without unnecessary complexity. Many applicants, particularly those applying to multiple positions, experience frustration due to redundancies in form-filling and unclear user flows. Our project seeks to address these issues by identifying key user pain points, analyzing existing solutions, and designing a system that prioritizes efficiency and user satisfaction.

Through needfinding, we will gather insights from real users who have applied for jobs via Workday. We will examine their experiences, identify common frustrations, and use these insights to guide our design improvements. 

\newpage

\section{Needfinding Plan}
\subsection {User Interviews}
One of the most effective ways to gather firsthand insights is through direct user interviews. Our goal is to interview at least five individuals who have applied for jobs through Workday. These participants will be recruited through personal networks, online communities, and classmates who have used Workday for job applications. We will conduct 20-minute semi-structured interviews, asking participants about their experiences, challenges, and desired improvements.

Our questions will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The overall ease or difficulty of using Workday for job applications
    \item The most frustrating aspects of the process
    \item Any workarounds they have developed to navigate the system
    \item Features they wish existed to improve their experience
\end{itemize}

Potential biases in this method include self-selection bias (since only individuals willing to be interviewed will participate) and recall bias (participants may forget specific details). To mitigate these biases, we will ensure diversity in our participant pool and encourage detailed responses by asking follow-up questions.
\hfill \break

\subsection {Online Survey}
To complement our interviews, we will deploy an online survey targeting approximately 20 participants. The survey will gather quantitative and qualitative data about job application experiences across various platforms, with a specific focus on Workday.
The survey will include a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions covering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency of job applications
    \item Platform usability ratings
    \item Specific pain points in application processes
    \item Demographic information to contextualize responses
\end{itemize}

Potential biases in this method include self-reporting bias in interviews and surveys, and Potential interviewer influence. 

\hfill \break
\subsection{Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Workday Interface}
In addition to user feedback, we will conduct a heuristic evaluation of Workday’s job application system. Using usability heuristics such as Jakob Nielsen’s ten usability principles, we will systematically analyze the interface to identify usability issues. Three team members will independently evaluate the system and then compare findings to reduce individual bias.

The heuristics we will focus on include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visibility of system status (Are users informed about the progress of their application?)
    \item Match between system and real-world expectations (Does Workday use familiar language and workflows?)
    \item User control and freedom (Can users easily correct mistakes or navigate backward?)
    \item Consistency and standards (Are interactions intuitive and consistent?)
    \item Error prevention (Does Workday prevent common mistakes, such as duplicate applications?)
\end{itemize}
A potential bias in heuristic evaluation is subjectivity, as different evaluators may perceive issues differently. To counter this, we will discuss findings collectively and highlight only those issues that multiple evaluators agree on.

\hfill \break

\section{Needfinding Results }
After executing our needfinding plan, we gathered valuable insights into the flaws of the Workday job application experience. Below, we summarize the key findings from each method and highlight the most significant takeaways.

\subsection{User Interviews}
We conducted five interviews with job seekers who have used Workday. Each participant expressed frustrations with the system, particularly regarding redundancy and poor navigation. Specific complaints included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The need to manually enter the same information multiple times, even when uploading a résumé
    \item Difficulty in saving progress, leading to lost applications when switching devices
    \item Lack of clear feedback on application status after submission
\end{itemize}
\hfill \break

\subsection{Online survey}

We reviewed over 15 online complaints about Workday’s job application system. The most common issues mentioned were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Repetitive form-filling that does not respect uploaded résumés
\item Unclear communication regarding next steps after applying
\item Frequent login timeouts and session expirations causing lost progress
\end{itemize}

One user wrote, “I dread seeing ‘Apply with Workday’ on job postings because I know it means spending 30 minutes filling out forms that should be auto-filled.”

One participant mentioned that they often avoid applying for jobs through Workday due to how tedious the process is, preferring alternative platforms where available. Another noted that Workday’s interface is not mobile-friendly, making it frustrating to apply on a phone.
\hfill \break

\subsection{Heuristic Evaluation}
Our heuristic evaluation confirmed many of the usability issues identified in the interviews. The main problems included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor visibility of system status: Users do not receive adequate feedback on the status of their applications.
\item Inconsistent design: Different companies using Workday customize their portals, leading to a lack of uniformity in the application experience.
\item Redundancy is a primary frustration. Users strongly dislike entering the same information multiple times. Many expect résumé parsing but find that Workday does not adequately auto-fill fields.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3. Heuristic Evaluation}

\textbf{Methodology}  

To systematically assess the usability of the Workday job application interface, we conducted a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics. Each evaluator independently reviewed the application process while documenting instances of usability violations and inefficiencies. The evaluation was conducted across different devices (desktop and mobile) to identify platform-specific issues. The results were then consolidated into key findings based on common themes.  

\textbf{Evaluation Criteria and Observations}  

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visibility of System Status}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The interface often lacks clear feedback after user actions. For instance, after submitting an application, there is no immediate confirmation, leaving users uncertain about whether their application was received.
        \item The status of applications is often vague or hidden under multiple navigation layers, making it difficult for users to track their progress.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{User Control and Freedom}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users lack the ability to edit their application after submission, forcing them to restart the entire process if they notice an error.
        \item Navigation between application sections is cumbersome, with no clear way to return to previous sections without losing progress.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Consistency and Standards}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different companies using Workday have varying interface layouts and application flows, leading to inconsistencies and confusion for repeat users.
        \item Icons and buttons sometimes lack uniformity in design and placement, making the interface feel disjointed.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Match Between System and Real-World Expectations}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users expect that uploading a résumé will auto-fill job history fields, but Workday often requires manual re-entry of the same information.
        \item The terminology used in error messages and instructions is sometimes unclear, requiring users to guess at corrective actions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Error Prevention}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many users experience session timeouts without warning, resulting in lost progress and frustration.
        \item Form validation is weak, allowing users to proceed with incomplete or incorrectly formatted fields, only to encounter an error message later in the process.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}  

Our heuristic evaluation revealed multiple usability flaws in Workday’s job application system, particularly in feedback mechanisms, navigation, and error handling. The findings from this evaluation will directly inform our redesign approach, prioritizing improvements in application transparency, user control, and streamlined workflows.
