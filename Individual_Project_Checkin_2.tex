\section{Initial Prototyping}
\subsection{Introduction}
This project focuses on redesigning the interface for the task of tracking workouts in a fitness app. The goal is to create a user-friendly, intuitive interface that addresses the pain points identified during needfinding, such as complex navigation, cluttered interfaces, and lack of personalization. Based on the needfinding results, three design alternatives have been developed, each targeting different aspects of the user experience.

\subsection{Design Alternatives}
Based on the insights gained from needfinding, I have brainstormed three design alternatives: Simplified Navigation Interface, Personalized Dashboard, and Integrated Fitness Data Interface. Each design aims to simplify navigation, enhance motivation features, and improve system feedback.

The Simplified Navigation Interface focuses on creating a streamlined interface with a "quick start" feature that allows users to log workouts with minimal navigation. The home screen will display essential features like workout logging, progress tracking, and goal setting in a simplified manner. This design addresses the need for simplified navigation and quick access to essential features, as identified during needfinding. The main features include a quick start feature, progress tracking, goal setting, and social features. The quick start feature allows users to log workouts with one tap, reducing the number of steps required to start tracking. Progress tracking displays key metrics such as calories burned, steps taken, and workout duration on the home screen. Goal setting provides an easy way to set and track fitness goals directly from the home screen. Social features include a dedicated section for community support and competition.

The Personalized Dashboard emphasizes personalization. The home screen will be tailored to the user's specific fitness goals, providing goal-specific recommendations and adaptive workout plans. The interface will also include motivational elements like progress badges and social features for community support. This design focuses on personalization and motivation, which were key concerns for users during needfinding. The main features include personalized recommendations, adaptive workout plans, motivational badges, and community support. Personalized recommendations provide workout suggestions based on the user's fitness goals and past performance. Adaptive workout plans adjust workout plans dynamically based on user progress and feedback. Motivational badges reward users with badges for achieving milestones, fostering a sense of accomplishment. Community support highlights social features such as group challenges and friend activities to encourage interaction.

The Integrated Fitness Data Interface aims to integrate fitness data from different sources, providing a unified tracking experience. The interface will include clear, real-time feedback mechanisms and intuitive icons and labels to make the app accessible to both novice and experienced users. This design addresses the need for integrated fitness data and clear feedback mechanisms, as identified during needfinding. The main features include data integration, real-time feedback, intuitive icons and labels, and accessible design. Data integration combines data from multiple fitness devices and apps to provide a unified view of user progress. Real-time feedback offers immediate feedback on workout metrics, ensuring users are always aware of their current status. Intuitive icons and labels use clear and recognizable icons and labels to make navigation easy for all users. Accessible design ensures that the interface is user-friendly for both novice and experienced fitness enthusiasts.

\subsection {Low-Fidelity Prototypes}
For each design alternative, I have created a low-fidelity prototype to visualize the key features and layout. Below are descriptions each prototype.

\section{Prototypes}
\subsection{Prototype 1: Simplified Navigation Interface}
This prototype features a clean, minimalistic home screen with easy access to the "quick start" workout logging feature. The navigation bar at the bottom includes icons for tracking progress, setting goals, and accessing social features. The interface is designed to reduce cognitive load and make it easy for users to log workouts quickly. The quick start feature allows users to log workouts with one tap, reducing the number of steps required to start tracking. Progress tracking displays key metrics such as calories burned, steps taken, and workout duration on the home screen. Goal setting provides an easy way to set and track fitness goals directly from the home screen. Social features include a dedicated section for community support and competition.

\subsection {Prototype 2: Personalized Dashboard}
The personalized dashboard prototype offers a tailored home screen based on the user's fitness goals. It includes goal-specific recommendations, adaptive workout plans, and progress badges to keep users motivated. The social features are prominently displayed to encourage community support and competition. Personalized recommendations provide workout suggestions based on the user's fitness goals and past performance. Adaptive workout plans adjust workout plans dynamically based on user progress and feedback. Motivational badges reward users with badges for achieving milestones, fostering a sense of accomplishment. Community support highlights social features such as group challenges and friend activities to encourage interaction.

\subsection {Prototype 3: Integrated Fitness Data Interface}
This prototype integrates data from various fitness sources, providing a comprehensive tracking experience. The home screen displays real-time feedback on workout progress, using intuitive icons and labels. The interface is designed to be accessible to both novice and experienced users, with clear and immediate feedback mechanisms. Data integration combines data from multiple fitness devices and apps to provide a unified view of user progress. Real-time feedback offers immediate feedback on workout metrics, ensuring users are always aware of their current status. Intuitive icons and labels use clear and recognizable icons and labels to make navigation easy for all users. Accessible design ensures that the interface is user-friendly for both novice and experienced fitness enthusiasts.
